See the [online documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/nebulex_adapters_cachex/)
for more information.

**NOTE:** This adapter only supports Nebulex v2.0.0 onwards.

## Installation

Add `:nebulex_adapters_cachex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nebulex_adapters_cachex, "~> 2.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

You can define a cache using Cachex as follows:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Cache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Cachex
end
```

Where the configuration for the cache must be in your application
environment, usually defined in your `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.Cache,
  limit: 1_000_000,
  stats: true,
  ...
```

If your application was generated with a supervisor (by passing `--sup`
to `mix new`) you will have a `lib/my_app/application.ex` file containing
the application start callback that defines and starts your supervisor.
You just need to edit the `start/2` function to start the cache as a
supervisor on your application's supervisor:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    {MyApp.Cache, []},
  ]

  ...
end
```

Since Cachex uses macros for some configuration options, you could also
pass the options in runtime when the cache is started, either by calling
`MyApp.Cache.start_link/1` directly, or in your app supervision tree:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    {MyApp.Cache, cachex_opts()},
  ]

  ...
end

defp cachex_opts do
  import Cachex.Spec

  [
    expiration: expiration(
      # default record expiration
      default: :timer.seconds(60),

      # how often cleanup should occur
      interval: :timer.seconds(30),

      # whether to enable lazy checking
      lazy: true
    ),

    # complex limit
    limit: limit(
      size: 500,
      policy: Cachex.Policy.LRW,
      reclaim: 0.5,
      options: []
    ),

    ...
  ]
end
```

> See [Cachex.start_link/1][cachex_start_link] for more information
  about the options.

## Distributed caching topologies

In the same way we use the distributed adapters and the multilevel one to
create distributed topologies, we can also do the same but instead of using
the built-in local adapter using Cachex.

For example, let's define a multi-level cache (near cache topology), where
the L1 is a local cache using Cachex and the L2 is a partitioned cache.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.NearCache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :nebulex,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Multilevel

  defmodule L1 do
    use Nebulex.Cache,
      otp_app: :nebulex,
      adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Cachex
  end

  defmodule L2 do
    use Nebulex.Cache,
      otp_app: :nebulex,
      adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Partitioned,
      primary_storage_adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Cachex
  end
end
```

And the configuration may look like:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.NearCache,
  model: :inclusive,
  levels: [
    {MyApp.NearCache.L1, [limit: 100_000]},
    {MyApp.NearCache.L2, primary: [limit: 1_000_000]}
  ]
```

> **NOTE:** You could also use [NebulexRedisAdapter][nbx_redis_adapter] for L2,
  it would be matter of changing the adapter for the L2 and the configuration
  for set up Redis adapter.

See [Nebulex examples](https://github.com/cabol/nebulex_examples). You will
find examples for all different topologies, even using other adapters like
Redis; for all examples you just have to replace `Nebulex.Adapters.Local`
by `Nebulex.Adapters.Cachex`.

## Testing

Since `Nebulex.Adapters.Cachex` uses the support modules and shared tests
from `Nebulex` and by default its test folder is not included in the Hex
dependency, the following steps are required for running the tests.

First of all, make sure you set the environment variable `NEBULEX_PATH`
to `nebulex`:

```
export NEBULEX_PATH=nebulex
```

Second, make sure you fetch `:nebulex` dependency directly from GtiHub
by running:

```
mix nbx.setup
```

Third, fetch deps:

```
mix deps.get
```

Finally, you can run the tests:

```
mix test
```

Running tests with coverage:

```
mix coveralls.html
```

You will find the coverage report within `cover/excoveralls.html`.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks were added using [benchee](https://github.com/PragTob/benchee), and
they are located within the directory [benchmarks](./benchmarks).

To run the benchmarks:

```
MIX_ENV=test mix run benchmarks/benchmark.exs
```

## Contributing

Contributions to Nebulex are very welcome and appreciated!

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cabol/nebulex_adapters_cachex/issues)
for bug reports or feature requests. Open a
[pull request](https://github.com/cabol/nebulex_adapters_cachex/pulls)
when you are ready to contribute.

When submitting a pull request you should not update the
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and also make sure you test your changes
thoroughly, include unit tests alongside new or changed code.

Before to submit a PR it is highly recommended to run `mix check` and ensure
all checks run successfully.
